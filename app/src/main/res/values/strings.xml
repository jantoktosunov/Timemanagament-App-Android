        In scoring, 5 points were assigned to the response at the end of the scale that we defined a priori as the "good" practice and 1 point was assigned to the response at the other end of the scale, with intermediate values given for the other responses.
        Higher values on the scale correspond to better timemanagement practices.</string>
